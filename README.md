##
A calibrated camera projects 3D points onto the image plane due to their linear constraint by 2 planes :

## 
Dimensionality reduction using PCA concept, we can extract its eigenvectors, namely == EigenFaces :

## 
Edge detection using Hough-Transform (upper) and Laplacian Pyramid as an image blender (lower) :

## Requirements
Python 3.4, OpenCV (cv2) and other common packages listed in `requirements.txt` at the [OpenCV_demo](https://github.com/Daniboy370/Computer-Vision/blob/master/OpenCV_Demo/OpenCV_demo.py) directory.

## Course homeworks
Along the course I have implementesd several small-size projects in different CV topics, available [here](https://github.com/Daniboy370/Computer-Vision/tree/master/Homeworks)
